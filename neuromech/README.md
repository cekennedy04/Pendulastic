# neuromech — the knee-spasticity emulator program

Plays programmed pendulum-test swings on the LabVIEW motor rig, then scores every run from the encoder
(truth) and the phone, through the validated production scorer. Plan:
`docs/plans/2026-10-26-001-plan-neuromech-emulator-unified.md`. LabVIEW side:
`neuromech/labview/LABVIEW_PROGRAM_SPEC.md`.

Run everything from the repo root with the project venv (`.venv/Scripts/python.exe`), with
`PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8` and `OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS=1`.

## 1. Build the scenario library (once, or after a model change)

```bash
python -m neuromech.build                # 55 scenarios -> neuromech/out/ (manifest + 1 kHz setpoints)
```

| Group | What | Source |
|---|---|---|
| A | PT7-band presets P0–P3 (not MAS settings — plan D5) | De Groote core, calibrated to band centres |
| S | the published severity axis, including where PT7 inverts | De Groote core |
| B | behaviours: flexor/extensor, clasp-knife, clonus, rigidity, contracture, hypotonia, guarding, spasm, habituation | De Groote core + modules |
| C | each of the 7 parameters and the A0 gate pushed out of range | De Groote core + kinematic transforms |
| D | release artefacts: push, wobble, short record, low lift | De Groote core |
| M | severity AND kind of severity: tone ladder, catch-release, catch-and-hold, no-ringdown fall, end-stop | De Groote core, via `profiles.py` |
| R | the four mechanisms B9 ported, one at a time: bearing friction, anthropometry, tonic arrest, reflex channel | De Groote core |

`out/scenario_manifest.csv` holds, per scenario, the expected 7 parameters, PT7, band or refusal, flags,
the rig range and speed it needs, and the peak active muscle torque (for Mode C).

## 2. Plan a session

```bash
python -m neuromech.session plan --name S2026-10-28 --groups A,M --reps 3 --repeat A-P2:10 --chirp
```

Writes `neuromech/sessions/<name>/`: `runsheet.csv` (what the operator sees — run ids only, R3 blind),
`key.csv` (run → scenario; keep it from anyone grading), and `commands/<run>.csv` + `<run>.dbl`
(big-endian float64, 5 interleaved columns: t, setpoint, velocity, acceleration, phase — LabVIEW
"Read from Binary File"). `R000` is the 20 s identification chirp.

## 3. At the bench (per run)

Start the phone → start the LabVIEW log, **named `<run>.bin`** → play `commands/<run>.dbl` →
let the app auto-stop → stop the phone → stop the log. The file name is the pairing; nothing else is.

## 4. Score the session

```bash
python -m neuromech.session score --name S2026-10-28 --encoder-dir <folder of R*.bin> \
       --phone-manifest <phone session>-manifest.json
```

Per run: encoder-delivered vs intended parameters and band, tracking RMSE, and the phone's parameters
(aligned on the three sync pulses, mounting sign detected, gyro bias taken from the stillness before
release — what the app itself can see). `R000` reports the identified plant.
Output: `sessions/<name>/report.csv` and a printed summary.

## 5. Correct the commands (ILC)

```bash
python -m neuromech.ilc --identify <R000.bin>                     # -> plant JSON
python -m neuromech.ilc commands/R014.csv R014.bin --plant <plant.json>   # -> R014_ilc1.csv
```

Error is always measured against the original scenario, so iterations converge on the scenario, not on
each other. Re-identify after any gain change.

## 6. Dry run without hardware

```bash
python -m neuromech.dryrun
```

Plans a session, synthesises LabVIEW `.bin` logs through the identified plant and a phone gyro (59 Hz,
jitter, reversed mount, real-size bias), and scores it like a real session. Result 2026-10-26:
every run in its intended band, median tracking 0.57°, phone |ΔPT7| median 0.009 (max 0.16, bias-limited),
plant recovered (6.35 Hz, ζ 0.232, R² 0.999), ILC converging on every scenario including the 2.3 Hz case.

## Tests

```bash
python -m pytest neuromech/tests tests/test_rig_calibration.py      # 61 tests
node neuromech/labview/verify_formula_node.js                       # Formula Node vs Python, 1e-11
```
