workbench_engine.py
====================
Pure ingestion/metrics engine for the Pendulastic Workbench: no Tkinter
dependency, fully unit-testable. Reuses analysis_pipeline.py's HPE-model/
OptiTrack/alignment/RMSE engine and imu_calibration_tuner.py's AHRS replay
engine rather than duplicating them.

See docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-31-pendulastic-workbench-design.md.

    the last detected peak/trough extremum, or the last index if fewer than
    4 samples or no extrema are found at all (a flat/near-flat signal has no
    "tail to exclude").

    Ported from diagnose_area_ratio.py's extract_robust (its "active-window
    mask", P6) as a standalone, general-purpose primitive -- see design spec
    Section 4a for why this is workbench-local rather than a refactor of
    pendulastic_pt_score.compute_pt_params or imu_calibration_tuner's own
    settle-detection logic.

    Deliberate simplification vs. extract_robust's original: prominence is
    scaled from the signal's own overall span (max-min) rather than a
    separately-computed pre-release extension amplitude (A0), since this
    function does not do release-detection itself -- it operates on
    whatever (t, angle) series it's given.
